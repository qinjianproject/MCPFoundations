From a young age, Xiao Yan was regarded by many within the family and宗门 as an underachiever or \"useless\" young master due to his lack of early cultivation prowess, which contrasted sharply with the lofty expectations placed upon him as a member of such a prestigious lineage. Despite these initial shortcomings, Xiao Yan demonstrated remarkable courage and conviction when he made the bold decision to break off his engagement with Nalan Yanran, a highly regarded disciple from another influential faction. This act was considered audacious and unprecedented, as such arranged engagements often carried significant political and strategic weight within the宗门 hierarchy.\n\nWhile Xiao Yan's early days were marked by mediocrity and disappointment, his decision to sever ties with Nalan Yanran signified a turning point and hinted at the potential for personal growth and inner strength. It marked the beginning of a journey where he would likely strive to prove himself not only to his family and宗门 but also to the wider cultivation world. The Yan Zong宗门, being a central part of his identity and background, plays a crucial role in shaping the context of Xiao Yan’s early life and the challenges he faces as a young cultivator from a noble bloodline.\n\nAs Xiao Yan moves forward, the expectations tied to his family name and the influence of the Yan Zong宗门 will continue to be significant forces in his development. Despite being labeled as \"useless\" at a young age, his actions already suggest the potential for a deeper narrative—one of resilience, ambition, and the desire to carve out a destiny independent of others' expectations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1754441045, "model": "qwen-plus", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 346, "prompt_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 542, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
